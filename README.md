# Election_Analysis

# Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

 1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
 2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
 3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
 4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
 5. Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

# Resources

 1. Data Source: election_results.csv
 2. Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.54.1

# Summary: The analysis of the election show that:

1. There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
 2. The Candidates were:
        * Charles Casper Stockham
        * Diana DeGette
        * Raymon Anthony Doane

 3. The candidates results were:
        * Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
        * Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
        * Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

 4. The winner of the election was:
        * Winner: Diana DeGette
        * Winning Vote Count: 272,892
        * Winning Percentage: 73.8%
 
 5. Largest County Turnout: 
        * Denver
 
 6. County Votes:
        * Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
        * Denver: 82.8% (306,055)

# Challenge Overview
In this module, we wrote a Python code to analyze the total number of votes cast in a local congressional election by candidate and county, representing with count and percentages. We have prepared The Election Results Printed to the Command-Line, The Election Results Saved to Text File, and The written Analysis of the Election audit.

# Election-Audit Summary: 
We wrote a Python Script to audit and analyze the Colorado Board of Elections of a recent local congressional election. The election commission can use the script with some modification for auditing any election. For example, The script can perform an analysis and audits the candidate's votes outlining the winner. Also, it will provide vote counts and the percentage by the candidate. It can even analyze and audits votes by county with some modification, providing the largest county turnout with vote counts and percentage.      (There are no pictures to attached in this module and the code and structured is provided in the Pypoll_Challenge.py)
